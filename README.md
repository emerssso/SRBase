SRBase
======

SR Base is an Android application compatible with Android versions 4.3+.
It may be compatible with older 4.0+ versions as well, but they have not been tested.

This app is intended to help in recording Service Record  (SR) information for multi-day
service jobs, and produce a nicely formatted summary suitable for entry on work reports.
It's designed to have as simple and quick a UI as possible so that things load quickly on-the-go.
This is based on my father's work requirements, but if it works for you as well, great!
Let me know if there is some feature you would like to see, and I'll try to work it in.

If someone wiser in the way of Android development stumbles upon this app and sees some
modifications/improvements/optimizations, let me know! I started this as a learning project
to see how Android development has changed since I first wrote apps for Gingerbread, and 
I feel like there's definitely room for improvement.
